# sama7g54-ek-audio-ml-egdeimpulse
Predictive maintenance using audio-based fault detection in motor systems. This project uses Edge Impulse for model development and deploys real-time classification on the SAMA7G54 Evaluation Kit, combining AI with audio signal processing for advanced audio applications.

Audio-based machine learning applications have emerged as powerful tools across various industries enabling everything from voice assistants and speech recognition to predictive maintenance in industrial systems. By analyzing audio signals, machine learning applications can uncover hidden patterns and insights across a range of scenarios from environmental sound monitoring to industrial health diagnostics offering a non-intrusive and cost-effective means of assessing system performance and detecting anomalies.

This project demonstrates such an audio ML application in the context of machine health monitoring. Using Mel-filter bank Energy (MFE) features, it captures key frequency characteristics of machine audio data. A neural network then classifies the machine‚Äôs condition into categories such as "good," "broken fault," and "heavy load motor." The system‚Äôs capabilities are showcased through deployment on an embedded Linux device (SAMA7G54 Evaluation Kit), achieving robust and real-time classification with high accuracy.
